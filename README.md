Debugging Life & Code." is a personal Blog where I share thoughts, life events and of course some programming progress. With this blog, I aim to reach a wide audience, including people with disabilities. That's why my blog will look according to the WCAG rules. I hope to bring some joy and laughter in peoples everyday life.
