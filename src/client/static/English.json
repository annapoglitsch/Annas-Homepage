My first encounters were in the lower grades during the computer science practice, which led me to choose the technical track and my current education. The study program in Computer Science and Digital Communication combines all the areas I want to explore further and eventually master. Since then, mathematics, programming, and various team projects have been part of my daily life. I have learned to adapt to new workflows, stay focused on my goal, and ask for help when needed. In addition to my studies, I work part-time at ITSV, where I can apply what I have learned in practice.",
